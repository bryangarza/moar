Moar:
===================================

__Mo__dify __a__nd __R__eload

This short Ruby script checks a file for timestamp
changes to determine that it's been modified, and
then runs any command you would like, such as 
reloading the file or running rake. I find it much
easier to use than other scripts that "watch" a
file.
